# Nugets Workshop
_One massive feature of VL is its ability to consume almost any .NET nuget and turn it into nodes. As patchers, this gives us access to thousands of libraries to solve our problems. Sometimes though, those libraries might not exactly fit the approach we're used to from visual programming : taken out of the box, nodes can use exotic types, or simply be way too complicated to use in a high-level dataflow approach._

_In this workshop, we'll learn what is the nuget ecosystem, and with hands-on examples, download nugets and make them fit our patching habits._

## 1Ô∏è. Introduction
_We'll learn what is the nuget ecosystem, and how a plugin in structured._

### NuGet ecosystem
- Think of nuget as a database for .NET libraries (similar to JS' `npm` or python's `pip`)
- Those nugets come in `.dll` format, and can be used with any language of the .NET framework (C# and VB, and now VL !)
    - As C# or VB, VL is a language for the .NET framework

#### Things to do :

- Open the Nuget Gallery
- Browse, show a nuget page
- Explain the "structure" of the nuget page

### Small demo : String.Extensions
- Let's install [StringExtensionsLibrary](https://www.nuget.org/packages/StringExtensionsLibrary/), a convenience nuget that contains many functions that allow us to do string manipulations
- We read the [Github descriptions](https://github.com/timothymugayi/StringExtensions), and see many usefull functions that could be usefull in our patches
- We install the nuget, reference it in our patch, and new category shows up in the node browser
- Let's look at the node browser and the Github page side by side : that's a match !
- Let's use a cool node and see it works instantly in our dataflow approach

## 2. Tailoring a nuget for VL usage
_Coming from the textual programming world, nugets might not always fit our patching habits out of the box. In this section, we'll se how we can overcome those problems and wrap .NET libs to make them patch-friendly._

### Incompatible types
_.NET libraries might return types that are not convenient for us to use in VL. Sometimes, they're not even compatible, even though they have the same name. Let's see how we can overcome that._

#### Hands on : GeometryTools
- Open the example patch : we want to color a line when the circle intersects it.
- After some searching, we've found [this nuget](https://www.nuget.org/packages/GeometryTools/)
- The GeometryTools nuget has a `IsPointOnLineSegment` operation, but its input are not compatible with our Vector2 IOBoxes
- Let's create a wrapper node that takes care of the type conversion

#### Hands on : ColorThief
- Open the example patch : we want to retrieve a color palette from an image.
- After looking around on the net, we find the [ColorThief](https://www.nuget.org/packages/ksemenenko.ColorThief/) library that seems to do what we want.
- Let's look at the code example provided on the [repo](https://github.com/KSemenenko/ColorThief)
- We install it, find the `GetPalette` node, but its inputs are not that VL friendly...
    - The node turns pink : it's a warning
- We create a wrapper node that takes care of making it more suited for our patching life
- Let's expose the color count and give it a default value
- Mention the fact that nodes must always return a Spread.

### Events
_There are many ways in C# to express the concept of events. In VL, the prefered paradigm is Observables. If a plugin uses the [.NET Core Event Pattern](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/modern-events), VL automatically converts it to an Observable. There are other cases though where we'll need to adapt the nodes so we can cosume them._

#### Hands on : OpenWeatherMap.Standard
- We want to retrieve some real-time weather data from a specific city. After digging, we find the [OpenWeather.Standard](https://www.nuget.org/packages/OpenWeatherMap.Standard/) nuget that allows us to easily use the Open Weather API.
- We go on the [Open Weather](https://openweathermap.org/guide) website to generate an API key
- We install the nuget and reference it in our doc
- The lib's repo does not show any code example. Let's look at the [test files](https://github.com/vb2ae/OpenWeatherMap.Standard/blob/master/OpenWeatherMap.Standard.Test/CityNameTests.cs) to see how we can use the lib.


### Unmanaged dependencies
_Some .NET libraries might in turn use libraries themselves. Sometimes, those libraries are not written in C# but rather in an unmanaged language such as C++. Those are called "native dependencies". For quite some time, there was no clear recommandation for nuget packages as where to put those native dependencies : anyone could come up with their own folder structure. As a result, gamma won't be able to pick those up automatically : we have to explicitely tell it where to look for those dlls._

#### Hands on : DupImageLib
- Check the example patch : we want to calculate some similarity score between two images.
- Again, after digging the internets, we find this [DupImageLib](https://www.nuget.org/packages/DupImageLib/) library that performs perceptual hashing.
- Let's look at the code example provided on [the repo](https://github.com/Quickshot/DupImageLib)
- Sadly, the node throws an error message, it looks like it cannot find a dependency.
- Let's create a bat file that adds our nuget's native dependency to gamma's search path and restart gamma : alles gut now, we can patch!

## 3. Create a wrapper lib
_We now know how to use existing nugets and tailors them for further usage in a VL patch. But how could we build re-usable blocks that are not tied to the project we're working on? Here we'll see how we can create our own VL library._

#### Hands on : AetherPhysics
- We'll start by downloading the `Aether.Physics2D.NetStandard`package
- Then, we'll create a new document named `VL.2d.Physics` : just by referencing this VL doc in our project, we'll have access to all the features of the physics library
- Now we'll need to forward Classes, it means that our `VL.2d.Physics` document will then expose those classes to the other documents that are referencing it
- We'll need to adapt a few things : create conversion operation for Vectors, change `MutableList<T>` to `Spread<T>`, etc
- Now, let's create a document that has a reference to our `VL.2d.Physics` document : see how the forwarded class appear in the node browser
- Let's write some documentation for the utils we've created
